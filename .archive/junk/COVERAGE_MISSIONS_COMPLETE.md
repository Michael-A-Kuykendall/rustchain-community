## 🚀 Generated Mission Files

### Master Coordination
- **`000_master_coverage_campaign.yaml`** - Orchestrates all 60 missions

### Individual Coverage Missions (Sample)
1. **`coverage_mission_001_src_core_chain.yaml`** - Chain System (79.1% → 85%+)
2. **`coverage_mission_002_src_llm_azure_openai_provider.yaml`** - Azure LLM (LOW → 85%+)
3. **`coverage_mission_003_src_build_dashboard.yaml`** - Build Dashboard (LOW → 85%+)
4. **`coverage_mission_014_src_core_tools.yaml`** - Core Tools (58.4% → 85%+)
5. **`coverage_mission_022_src_engine_mod.yaml`** - Engine Module (44.2% → 85%+)

...and 55 more missions covering every file needing improvement.

## 🤖 Mission Architecture

### Each Mission Performs:
1. **AI Analysis** (Phi-3 Mini) - Analyzes code structure and identifies test gaps
2. **Test Generation** (Phi-3 Mini) - Creates comprehensive unit tests
3. **Integration** - Adds tests to source files automatically  
4. **Verification** - Runs tarpaulin to confirm 85%+ coverage achieved
5. **Self-Archival** - Moves completed mission to `missions/done/`
6. **Registry Update** - Updates coverage registry with new metrics

### Mission Flow
```
START → Analyze File → Generate Tests → Integrate → Verify → Archive → DONE
```

## 🎯 Execution Options

### Option 1: Master Campaign (Recommended)
```bash
# Execute the complete campaign - all 60 missions systematically
cargo run --bin rustchain --features llm -- run missions/coverage/000_master_coverage_campaign.yaml
```

### Option 2: Individual Mission Execution
```bash
# Execute a single high-priority mission
cargo run --bin rustchain --features llm -- run missions/coverage/coverage_mission_003_src_build_dashboard.yaml

# Execute CLI-focused missions
for mission in missions/coverage/coverage_mission_*cli*.yaml; do
  cargo run --bin rustchain --features llm -- run "$mission"
done
```

### Option 3: Priority-Based Execution
```bash
# Execute Python automation script (generated by master mission)
python execute_coverage_missions.py
```
