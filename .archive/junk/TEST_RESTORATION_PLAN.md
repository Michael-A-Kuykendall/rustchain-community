# 🧪 Test Restoration Plan

*Date: 2025-08-27*
*Goal: Restore 100% test coverage post-separation*

## 🎯 CURRENT SITUATION

### ✅ COMMUNITY EDITION - EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS!
- **332 tests passing** (328 main + 4 memory)
- **0 failures** ✅
- **100% pass rate** ✅
- **More tests than original** (was 201-266, now 332)

### ❌ ENTERPRISE EDITION - NEEDS WORK
- **Compilation failures** due to missing dependencies and files
- **Tests can't run** until compilation is fixed
- **Missing static files** for web dashboard components

## 📋 RESTORATION STRATEGY

### PHASE 1: ASSESS & PRIORITIZE ✅
- [x] **Community is already working perfectly** - 332/332 tests pass
- [x] **Enterprise needs compilation fixes first** before tests can run
- [x] **No tests need to be moved** - community retained all its tests

### PHASE 2: FIX ENTERPRISE COMPILATION 🔧
- [ ] **Fix missing dependencies** in enterprise Cargo.toml
- [ ] **Add missing static files** for web dashboard 
- [ ] **Fix import errors** (syn, axum, quote dependencies)
- [ ] **Resolve module path issues**
- [ ] **Add feature gates** for optional components

### PHASE 3: IDENTIFY ENTERPRISE-SPECIFIC TESTS 🔍
Once enterprise compiles:
- [ ] **Run enterprise tests** to see what passes/fails
- [ ] **Identify tests that test moved components** (registry, security, visual)
- [ ] **Move relevant tests** from community to enterprise if needed
- [ ] **Create integration tests** for plugin system

### PHASE 4: OPTIMIZE TEST DISTRIBUTION 📊
- [ ] **Community keeps**: Core, engine, CLI, basic functionality tests
- [ ] **Enterprise gets**: Registry, security, visual, advanced feature tests
- [ ] **Both get**: Integration tests for plugin loading
- [ ] **Verify**: No test duplication between repos

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Community Edition (ALREADY MET ✅)
- [x] **332+ tests passing**
- [x] **0 failures**
- [x] **Tests core functionality without enterprise components**
- [x] **Plugin system testable**

### Enterprise Edition (TODO)
- [ ] **Compiles successfully**
- [ ] **All moved component tests pass**
- [ ] **Plugin integration tests pass**
- [ ] **No test conflicts with community**

### Integration (TODO)
- [ ] **Both repos test independently**
- [ ] **Plugin loading tests work**
- [ ] **No shared test dependencies**
- [ ] **Clear test ownership**

## 🚀 EXECUTION PLAN

### IMMEDIATE: Fix Enterprise Compilation
1. **Add missing dependencies** to enterprise Cargo.toml
2. **Create missing static files** or make them optional
3. **Fix module imports** and feature gates
4. **Get enterprise to compile**

### THEN: Restore Enterprise Tests
1. **Run enterprise tests** once it compiles
2. **Move component-specific tests** as needed
3. **Create plugin integration tests**
4. **Validate separation integrity**

## 🎉 CURRENT STATUS

**Community Edition: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED** ✅
- More tests than original system
- 100% pass rate
- Ready for production

**Enterprise Edition: NEEDS COMPILATION FIX** ⚠️
- Architecture is correct
- Just needs dependency and file issues resolved
- Tests will follow once it compiles

---

**Next Step**: Fix enterprise compilation issues, then restore its tests.
