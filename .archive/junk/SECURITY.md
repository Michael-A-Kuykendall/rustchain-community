```
Subject: [SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Mission Execution Code Injection

Summary:
RustChain mission files can be exploited to execute arbitrary code during mission parsing.

Impact: 
- Remote code execution on systems processing untrusted mission files
- Potential for privilege escalation
- Affects all versions since v0.1.0

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create malicious mission file with embedded shell commands
2. Run: cargo run --bin rustchain -- run malicious.yaml
3. Observe arbitrary code execution

Environment:
- RustChain v0.2.0
- Rust 1.75.0
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Features: agent,chain,tools,llm
```

## ‚è∞ **Response Timeline**

We are committed to responding promptly to security reports:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of receiving your report
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours we'll provide an initial assessment
- **Updates**: Regular updates at least every 7 days during investigation
- **Resolution**: Timeline depends on complexity, typically 30-90 days

## üèÜ **Security Researcher Recognition**

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help make RustChain safer:

### **Hall of Fame**
Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Listed in our Security Hall of Fame (with permission)
- Credited in release notes and security advisories
- Acknowledged in the CHANGELOG.md
- Invited to our private security researcher Discord channel

### **Responsible Disclosure Guidelines**
To be eligible for recognition:
- Report vulnerabilities privately through proper channels
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain
- Do not access data that doesn't belong to you
- Be respectful and professional in communications

## üîí **Supported Versions**

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.3.x   | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| 0.2.x   | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| 0.1.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical fixes only |
| < 0.1   | ‚ùå No             |

### **End of Life Policy**
- **Current Release**: Full security support
- **Previous Release**: Security fixes for 6 months after next major release
- **Older Releases**: Critical vulnerabilities only, case-by-case basis

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features in RustChain**

RustChain includes several built-in security features:

### **Memory Safety**
- **Rust Language Guarantees**: Buffer overflow protection, memory safety
- **No Unsafe Code**: Core RustChain uses only safe Rust (with documented exceptions)
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular security audits of dependencies

### **Input Validation**
- **Mission Validation**: Schema validation before execution
- **Parameter Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Path Traversal Protection**: File operations are restricted to safe directories

### **Execution Safety**
- **Sandbox Mode**: Optional sandboxed execution for untrusted missions
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits on memory, CPU, and execution time
- **Privilege Dropping**: Execution with minimal required privileges

### **Enterprise Security**
- **Policy Engine**: Rule-based access control and governance
- **Audit Trails**: Cryptographic integrity chains for compliance
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for enterprise deployments
- **Compliance**: Built-in support for SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA standards

## üö® **Known Security Considerations**

### **Mission File Security**
- **Untrusted Sources**: Only run mission files from trusted sources
- **Code Review**: Review mission files before execution in production
- **Validation**: Always run `cargo run --bin rustchain -- mission validate` first

### **LLM Integration Security**
- **API Key Management**: Store API keys securely, never commit to repositories
- **Prompt Injection**: Be aware of potential prompt injection in user-provided content
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting for LLM API calls

### **Tool Execution Security**
- **Command Injection**: Built-in protections against command injection
- **File System Access**: File operations are restricted by policy engine
- **Network Access**: HTTP operations can be restricted by configuration

## üìö **Security Best Practices**

### **For Developers**
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies with security patches
- **Code Review**: All code changes should undergo security-focused review
- **Testing**: Include security test cases in your test suite
- **Configuration**: Use secure defaults and validate all configuration options

### **For Operators**
- **Least Privilege**: Run RustChain with minimal required permissions
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
- **Monitoring**: Enable audit logging and monitor for suspicious activity
- **Updates**: Apply security updates promptly

### **For Enterprise Users**
- **Policy Configuration**: Configure the policy engine for your security requirements
- **Compliance Reporting**: Enable audit trails for compliance requirements
- **Access Control**: Implement proper RBAC for multi-user environments
- **Incident Response**: Have a plan for responding to security incidents

## üîç **Security Audits and Assessments**
