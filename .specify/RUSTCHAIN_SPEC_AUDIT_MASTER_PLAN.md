## üìã EXECUTION PHASES

### **PHASE 1: CORE SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS (Day 1-2)**

#### 1.1 Mission Engine Specification
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Core differentiator
**Command**: `/specify`
**Input**: 
```
Create a comprehensive specification for RustChain's Mission Engine - a DAG-based execution system that supports 12 step types (CreateFile, Command, Http, Tool, LLM, Agent, Chain, etc.) with topological sorting, dependency resolution, policy validation, audit trails, and parallel execution capabilities. The engine must handle error recovery (fail-fast or continue-on-error), support variable substitution, and provide comprehensive logging for enterprise compliance.
```
**Expected Output**: 
- Feature branch: `001-mission-engine-spec`
- Specification: `specs/001-mission-engine-spec/spec.md`
- Validation against: `src/engine/mod.rs`, `src/engine/executor.rs`

#### 1.2 CLI System Specification  
**Priority**: HIGH - User-facing interface
**Command**: `/specify`
**Input**:
```
Create a specification for RustChain's comprehensive CLI interface with subcommands for mission execution (run, validate), configuration management (init, check), safety validation, tool execution, audit reporting, and interactive mode. The CLI must support feature flags, provide helpful error messages, and maintain backward compatibility.
```
**Expected Output**:
- Feature branch: `002-cli-system-spec`
- Specification: `specs/002-cli-system-spec/spec.md` 
- Validation against: `src/cli/mod.rs`, `src/cli/commands.rs`

#### 1.3 Tool Framework Specification
**Priority**: HIGH - Extensibility system  
**Command**: `/specify`
**Input**:
```
Create a specification for RustChain's extensible tool registration and execution framework with policy-based access control, parameter validation, audit logging, and plugin system. The framework must support built-in tools (file operations, HTTP, commands) and custom tool registration with proper error handling and security validation.
```
**Expected Output**:
- Feature branch: `003-tool-framework-spec`
- Specification: `specs/003-tool-framework-spec/spec.md`
- Validation against: `src/tools/mod.rs`, `src/core/tools.rs`

### **PHASE 2: ENTERPRISE FEATURES (Day 2-3)**

#### 2.1 Security & Compliance Specification
**Priority**: HIGH - Enterprise requirements
**Command**: `/specify`  
**Input**:
```
Create a specification for RustChain's security and compliance system including audit trails with cryptographic integrity, policy engine with rule-based access control, safety validation with risk assessment, and sandbox isolation. The system must support enterprise compliance (SOX, GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001) and provide comprehensive logging.
```

#### 2.2 LLM Integration Specification
**Priority**: MEDIUM - AI capabilities
**Command**: `/specify`
**Input**:
```
Create a specification for RustChain's multi-provider LLM integration supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and Shimmy providers with unified interface, connection pooling, retry logic, and cost tracking. Must handle both completion and chat formats with proper error handling and authentication.
```

### **PHASE 3: ADVANCED SYSTEMS (Day 3-4)**

#### 3.1 Agent & Chain Systems Specification
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Advanced AI features
**Command**: `/specify`

#### 3.2 Transpiler System Specification  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Migration capabilities
**Command**: `/specify`

#### 3.3 Memory & RAG System Specification
**Priority**: LOW - Supporting features
**Command**: `/specify`

### **PHASE 4: VALIDATION & PLANNING (Day 4-5)**

#### 4.1 Generate Implementation Plans
**Command**: `/plan` for each specification
**Validate**: Against existing implementation
**Document**: Gaps and improvements needed

#### 4.2 Create Task Breakdowns
**Command**: `/tasks` for each plan
**Output**: Actionable task lists for community contributors

#### 4.3 Constitutional Principles Update
**Update**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with RustChain-specific principles
