## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Optimizations (High Impact, Low Effort)

#### 1. Memory Allocation Optimization
**Location**: `src/engine/mod.rs:1567-1634`  
**Issue**: Unnecessary string cloning in hot paths  
**Recommendation**: Use string references where possible  
**Expected Impact**: 5-10% performance improvement  

```rust
// Current (Line 1567)
step_id.clone()

// Optimized
&step_id  // Use reference when ownership not required
```

#### 2. Tool Registration Caching
**Location**: `src/tools/mod.rs` (registration patterns)  
**Issue**: Tools re-registered on each operation  
**Recommendation**: Implement lazy static tool registry  
**Expected Impact**: 15-20% improvement in tool operations  

#### 3. JSON Serialization Optimization
**Location**: Mission execution pipeline  
**Issue**: Multiple serialization/deserialization cycles  
**Recommendation**: Use zero-copy deserialization where possible  
**Expected Impact**: 10-15% improvement in mission processing  

### Medium-Term Optimizations (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

#### 1. Async I/O Optimization
**Location**: HTTP and file operations  
**Recommendation**: Implement connection pooling and async batching  
**Expected Impact**: 20-30% improvement under load  

#### 2. Memory Pool Implementation
**Location**: Engine execution context  
**Recommendation**: Pre-allocated memory pools for frequent allocations  
**Expected Impact**: Reduced GC pressure, more consistent response times  

#### 3. Mission Plan Caching
**Location**: Mission validation and execution  
**Recommendation**: Cache validated mission plans  
**Expected Impact**: 50%+ improvement for repeated missions  

### Long-Term Optimizations (High Impact, High Effort)

#### 1. Native Binary Compilation
**Recommendation**: AOT compilation for specific deployment targets  
**Expected Impact**: Additional 2-5x performance improvement  

#### 2. Custom Allocator Implementation
**Recommendation**: Domain-specific memory allocator  
**Expected Impact**: Reduced memory fragmentation, improved cache locality  

## Performance Regression Testing Strategy
