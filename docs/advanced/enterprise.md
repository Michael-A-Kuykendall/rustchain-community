## üè¢ **ENTERPRISE VS COMMUNITY SEGREGATION AUDIT**

### **Current Feature Gating Implementation**

Our codebase implements clean feature segregation using Rust's compile-time feature flags:

```rust
// Enterprise features are properly gated
#[cfg(feature = "enterprise")]
pub mod agent_reinforcement_training;

#[cfg(feature = "enterprise")]  
pub mod registry;  // Mission marketplace functionality

#[cfg(feature = "enterprise")]
pub mod multi_tenant_support;

// Community features remain always available
pub mod core_agents;
pub mod mission_execution;
pub mod basic_tools;
```
