      label: Implementation Ideas
      description: Do you have ideas about how this could be implemented? (Optional but helpful)
      placeholder: |
        This could potentially be implemented by:
        1. Adding a new step type to the mission engine
        2. Creating a new trait in the tools framework  
        3. Extending the agent reasoning system
        
        Key considerations:
        - Performance impact should be minimal
        - Should integrate cleanly with existing features
        - Needs proper error handling and validation
