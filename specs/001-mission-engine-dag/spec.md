# Feature Specification: Mission Engine DAG-based Execution System

**Feature Branch**: `001-mission-engine-dag`  
**Created**: 2025-01-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Mission Engine: DAG-based mission execution system that supports 12+ step types (CreateFile, Command, Http, Tool, LLM, Agent, Chain, etc.) with topological sorting, dependency resolution, policy validation, audit trails, and parallel execution capabilities. Handles error recovery (fail-fast or continue-on-error), variable substitution, and provides comprehensive logging for enterprise compliance. Located at src/engine/mod.rs and related files."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature describes comprehensive mission execution engine 
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Mission operators, system administrators, automated agents
   ’ Actions: Execute missions, manage dependencies, validate policies, log activities
   ’ Data: Mission definitions, step results, execution context, audit trails
   ’ Constraints: Security validation, dependency resolution, timeout management
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific step type parameter schemas and validation rules]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Parallel execution limits and resource management policies]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section 
5. Generate Functional Requirements 
6. Identify Key Entities 
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Some clarifications needed but core functionality well-defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Operations teams and automated systems need to execute complex, multi-step workflows with dependencies, error handling, and compliance tracking. Users define missions as YAML configurations specifying steps, dependencies, and execution policies. The system executes these missions reliably with comprehensive audit trails for enterprise compliance requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a mission with 5 sequential steps, **When** mission is executed, **Then** all steps complete in correct dependency order with success status logged
2. **Given** a mission with parallel branches, **When** execution begins, **Then** independent steps execute concurrently while respecting dependency constraints
3. **Given** a mission with fail-fast enabled and step 2 fails, **When** error occurs, **Then** remaining steps are cancelled and failure is logged with detailed error context
4. **Given** a mission with continue-on-error enabled and step 2 fails, **When** error occurs, **Then** remaining steps continue execution and final status indicates partial failure
5. **Given** a mission exceeds timeout limits, **When** timeout is reached, **Then** execution is terminated gracefully with timeout status recorded
6. **Given** a mission violating security policies, **When** validation occurs, **Then** execution is blocked and policy violation is logged for audit

### Edge Cases
- What happens when circular dependencies are detected in mission step definitions?
- How does system handle resource exhaustion during parallel step execution?
- What occurs when mission definition contains malformed step parameters?
- How are orphaned steps handled when dependencies fail in continue-on-error mode?
- What happens when audit logging fails during mission execution?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST execute multi-step missions defined in structured configuration format
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate mission dependencies and detect circular references before execution
- **FR-003**: System MUST support topological sorting to determine optimal execution order
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle at least 12 different step types including file operations, commands, HTTP requests, tool invocations, LLM interactions, agent execution, and chain processing
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide configurable error handling with fail-fast and continue-on-error modes
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce timeout controls at mission and individual step levels
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate all operations against security policies before execution
- **FR-008**: System MUST log all execution activities with cryptographic audit trails for compliance
- **FR-009**: System MUST sanitize file paths and command inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities
- **FR-010**: System MUST support variable substitution and context sharing between steps
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide execution status tracking with detailed progress reporting
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle parallel execution within resource constraints [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific concurrency limits and resource thresholds]
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate step parameters against schemas [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: parameter validation rules for each step type]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide rollback capabilities for failed transactions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which step types support rollback operations]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Mission**: Complete workflow definition containing metadata, steps, dependencies, and execution configuration
- **MissionStep**: Individual operation within mission with unique identifier, type, parameters, and dependency relationships
- **ExecutionContext**: Runtime environment containing variables, state, and shared data between steps
- **StepResult**: Outcome record containing status, output data, error information, and execution duration
- **MissionResult**: Comprehensive execution summary with overall status, individual step results, and performance metrics
- **AuditTrail**: Immutable log records with cryptographic integrity for compliance and forensic analysis
- **PolicyEngine**: Rule validation system ensuring operations comply with security and governance requirements
