## Summary
A DAG-based mission execution engine that orchestrates complex multi-step workflows with dependency resolution, parallel execution, error handling, and enterprise compliance tracking. The engine supports 12+ step types (file operations, commands, HTTP requests, LLM interactions, agents, chains) with comprehensive audit trails and policy validation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+  
**Primary Dependencies**: tokio (async runtime), serde (serialization), anyhow (error handling), tracing (logging), uuid (identifiers)  
**Storage**: In-memory state with persistent audit trails and mission definitions  
**Testing**: cargo test with comprehensive unit and integration test coverage  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) with enterprise focus  
**Project Type**: single (core execution engine library)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms step execution overhead, support for 1000+ concurrent steps  
**Constraints**: Memory-efficient execution, cryptographic audit integrity, zero-trust security model  
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise-grade with support for complex mission graphs (100+ steps), high availability

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**RustChain Core Principles Assessment**:
- ✅ **Library-First**: Mission engine is core library exposing clean API
- ✅ **CLI Interface**: Engine accessible via rustchain CLI commands 
- ✅ **Test-First**: Comprehensive test coverage required before implementation
- ✅ **Security-First**: Built-in sanitization, policy validation, audit trails
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Enterprise compliance, error handling, observability

**Initial Constitution Check**: PASS ✅

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Core execution engine library

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Areas Identified**:
1. DAG execution algorithms and topological sorting optimization
2. Async Rust patterns for concurrent step execution  
3. Enterprise audit logging and cryptographic integrity
4. Security sanitization patterns for dynamic execution
5. Error recovery strategies in workflow engines

**Research Results**:

### DAG Execution & Topological Sorting
- **Decision**: Kahn's algorithm for topological sort with cycle detection
- **Rationale**: O(V+E) complexity, handles dependency validation, enables parallel execution planning
- **Alternatives considered**: DFS-based sorting (complex cycle detection), recursive approaches (stack overflow risk)

### Async Execution Patterns
- **Decision**: tokio::spawn with semaphore-based concurrency control
- **Rationale**: Efficient resource management, configurable parallelism, graceful degradation
- **Alternatives considered**: async-std (less ecosystem), manual thread management (complexity)

### Audit & Compliance
- **Decision**: Structured logging with serde + cryptographic chain validation
- **Rationale**: JSON serialization, immutable audit trails, enterprise compliance standards
- **Alternatives considered**: Binary formats (less readable), simple logging (insufficient for compliance)

### Security Model
- **Decision**: Multi-layer validation: input sanitization → policy check → sandbox execution
- **Rationale**: Defense in depth, configurable policies, prevent privilege escalation
- **Alternatives considered**: Single-layer security (insufficient), runtime-only validation (bypassable)

**Output**: research.md complete ✅

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model (data-model.md)
**Core Entities**:
- **Mission**: Workflow definition with metadata, steps, and configuration
- **MissionStep**: Individual operation with type, parameters, dependencies
- **ExecutionContext**: Runtime state, variables, and inter-step communication
- **StepResult**: Execution outcome with status, output, error details
- **AuditEvent**: Immutable log entry with cryptographic integrity

### API Contracts (contracts/)
**Core Engine APIs**:
```rust
// Mission execution interface
pub async fn execute_mission(mission: Mission) -> Result<MissionResult>

// Step execution interface  
pub async fn execute_step(step: &MissionStep, context: &mut ExecutionContext) -> Result<StepResult>

// Policy validation interface
pub fn validate_mission(mission: &Mission) -> Result<()>

// Audit interface
pub async fn log_audit_event(event: AuditEvent) -> Result<()>
```

### Contract Tests Generated
- Mission execution success scenarios
- Error handling and recovery patterns  
- Policy validation enforcement
- Audit trail integrity verification
- Concurrent execution safety

### Quickstart Validation (quickstart.md)
**5-minute validation scenario**:
1. Create simple 3-step mission (file create → command → cleanup)
2. Execute via CLI: `rustchain mission execute test.yaml`
3. Verify audit trail: `rustchain audit report`
4. Validate policy enforcement: `rustchain policy check`

**Post-Design Constitution Check**: PASS ✅
- All principles maintained in design
- Clean separation of concerns
- Enterprise security and compliance requirements met

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load existing engine implementation and identify gaps
- Generate validation tasks for 12+ step type implementations
- Create comprehensive test coverage for DAG execution scenarios
- Security validation and policy enforcement testing
- Performance benchmarking and optimization tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Security and validation infrastructure first
- Core execution engine enhancement
- Step type implementation and testing
- Integration testing and CLI enhancement
- Performance optimization and enterprise features

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks focused on validation and enhancement

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - all principles maintained*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
