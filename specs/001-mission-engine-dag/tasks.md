## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
- **Setup (T001-T004) → Tests (T005-T010) → Implementation (T011-T027) → Integration (T028-T037) → Polish (T038-T048)**

### Specific Dependencies
- T005-T010 must fail before T011-T017 can begin (TDD requirement)
- T011 (Mission validation) blocks T015 (error recovery)
- T012 (DAG executor) blocks T028 (CLI integration)
- T014 (ExecutionContext) blocks T029 (E2E tests)
- T016 (audit events) blocks T032 (audit persistence)
- T028-T032 must complete before T043-T045 (performance tests)

### Parallel Execution Blocks
**Block 1 - Security Tests (T005-T010)**:
```rust
// Can run simultaneously - different test files
cargo test test_security_validation
cargo test test_command_security  
cargo test test_policy_enforcement
cargo test test_audit_integrity
cargo test test_dag_validation
cargo test test_error_handling
```

**Block 2 - Core Enhancements (T011-T014)**:
```rust
// Can run simultaneously - different concerns in same file
// Split into separate functions/modules for parallel development
```

**Block 3 - Step Type Validation (T018-T027)**:
```rust
// Can run simultaneously - independent step type implementations
cargo test test_file_operations
cargo test test_database_operations
cargo test test_ai_ml_operations
```

## Parallel Example
```bash
# Launch Block 1 (Security Tests) together:
Task: "Security validation test for path sanitization in tests/engine/test_security_validation.rs"
Task: "Command injection prevention test in tests/engine/test_command_security.rs"
Task: "Policy engine validation test in tests/engine/test_policy_enforcement.rs"
Task: "Audit trail integrity test in tests/engine/test_audit_integrity.rs"

# After Block 1 completes, launch Block 2 (Core Enhancements):
Task: "Enhance Mission struct validation in src/engine/mod.rs"
Task: "Improve DagExecutor topological sorting in src/engine/mod.rs"
Task: "Strengthen security sanitization in src/engine/mod.rs"
Task: "Enhance ExecutionContext management in src/engine/context.rs"
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Security Requirements
- All file path inputs must be sanitized using existing `sanitize_file_path()` function
- All command inputs must be validated using existing `sanitize_command()` function
- Policy engine must be consulted before executing any potentially dangerous operations
- Audit events must be generated for all security-relevant operations

### Performance Targets
- **Step Execution Overhead**: <200ms per step for simple operations
- **Parallel Throughput**: Support 1000+ concurrent step executions
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for missions with 1000+ steps
- **Startup Time**: <5s for engine initialization

### Testing Requirements
- All new functionality must have corresponding tests
- Tests must achieve >95% code coverage for mission engine components
- Security tests must validate both positive and negative cases
- Performance tests must verify target metrics are met

### Documentation Requirements
- All public APIs must have comprehensive documentation
- Security considerations must be documented for each step type
- Performance characteristics must be documented with benchmarks
- Examples must be provided for common use cases

## Notes
- **[P] tasks**: Different files or independent concerns, no dependencies
- **Verify tests fail**: Before implementing, confirm tests fail as expected
- **Commit frequently**: After each task completion for easier rollback
- **Existing code**: Leverage and enhance existing implementation rather than rewrite
- **Security first**: All enhancements must maintain or improve security posture

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts (mission_execution_api.json)**:
   - Mission execution endpoints → integration tests (T028, T029)
   - Validation endpoints → validation tests (T009)
   - Audit endpoints → audit tests (T008, T032)

2. **From Data Model (6 entities)**:
   - Mission → validation enhancement (T011)
   - MissionStep → step type validation (T018-T027)
   - ExecutionContext → context management (T014)
   - StepResult → result handling tests (T010)
   - MissionResult → aggregation tests (T029)
   - AuditEvent → audit integrity (T008, T035)

3. **From User Stories (quickstart.md)**:
   - 5-minute validation → quickstart tests (T038-T040)
   - Security scenarios → security tests (T005-T007)
   - Performance scenarios → performance tests (T043-T045)

4. **From Research (enterprise requirements)**:
   - Compliance standards → compliance features (T034)
   - Security patterns → security validation (T005-T007)
   - Performance targets → performance tests (T043-T045)
