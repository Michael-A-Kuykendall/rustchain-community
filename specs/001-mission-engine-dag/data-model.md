# Data Model: Mission Engine DAG-based Execution System

**Generated**: 2025-01-20  
**Context**: Core data structures for enterprise mission execution engine

## Entity Overview

The mission execution engine revolves around five core entities that manage workflow definition, execution state, and audit compliance.

## Core Entities

### Mission
**Purpose**: Complete workflow definition containing all steps, dependencies, and execution configuration

**Key Attributes**:
- `version`: Schema version for backward compatibility
- `name`: Human-readable mission identifier
- `description`: Optional detailed mission purpose
- `steps`: Vector of ordered mission steps
- `config`: Optional execution configuration settings

**Relationships**:
- Contains 1 to N MissionSteps
- May reference ExecutionContext for default variables
- Produces exactly one MissionResult upon execution

**Validation Rules**:
- Must contain at least one step
- Step IDs must be unique within mission
- Dependency references must exist within mission steps
- Circular dependencies are prohibited

**State Transitions**:
```
Defined → Validated → Executing → Completed/Failed/Cancelled
```

### MissionStep
**Purpose**: Individual operation within mission with dependencies and execution parameters

**Key Attributes**:
- `id`: Unique identifier within mission scope
- `name`: Human-readable step description
- `step_type`: Enumerated operation type (CreateFile, Command, Http, etc.)
- `depends_on`: Optional vector of prerequisite step IDs
- `timeout_seconds`: Optional step-specific timeout override
- `continue_on_error`: Optional error handling flag
- `parameters`: JSON object containing step-specific configuration

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to exactly one Mission
- May depend on 0 to N other MissionSteps
- Produces exactly one StepResult upon execution
- May reference shared ExecutionContext variables

**Validation Rules**:
- Step ID must be unique within mission
- Dependencies must reference existing steps within same mission
- Step type must match supported operations
- Parameters must conform to step type schema
- Circular dependencies are prohibited

**State Transitions**:
```
Pending → Ready → Executing → Completed/Failed/Skipped
```

### ExecutionContext
**Purpose**: Runtime environment containing variables, state, and shared data between steps

**Key Attributes**:
- `variables`: Key-value map of runtime variables
- `secrets`: Secure storage for sensitive values
- `step_outputs`: Map of step ID to output data
- `metadata`: Execution metadata (start time, user, etc.)
- `audit_trail`: Reference to audit event stream

**Relationships**:
- Shared across all steps within a mission execution
- Updated by each step execution
- Referenced by audit events for context

**Validation Rules**:
- Variable names must follow naming conventions
- Secrets must be encrypted at rest
- Step outputs must be JSON-serializable
- Context size limits prevent memory exhaustion

**State Lifecycle**:
```
Created → Initialized → Active → Archived
```

### StepResult
**Purpose**: Execution outcome record containing status, output data, error information, and timing

**Key Attributes**:
- `step_id`: Reference to executed step
- `status`: Enumerated execution status (Completed, Failed, Skipped)
- `output`: JSON object containing step-produced data
- `error`: Optional error message for failed steps
- `duration_ms`: Execution time in milliseconds
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 execution completion time

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to exactly one MissionStep
- Referenced by MissionResult for aggregation
- Linked to AuditEvents for compliance tracking

**Validation Rules**:
- Status must match actual execution outcome
- Error field required for Failed status
- Output must be JSON-serializable
- Timing data must be accurate

**State Immutability**:
Results are immutable once created to ensure audit integrity

### MissionResult
**Purpose**: Comprehensive execution summary with overall status, step results, and performance metrics

**Key Attributes**:
- `mission_id`: Reference to executed mission
- `overall_status`: Aggregated status (Success, Partial, Failed)
- `step_results`: Map of step ID to StepResult
- `start_time`: Mission execution start timestamp
- `end_time`: Mission execution completion timestamp
- `total_duration_ms`: Total execution time
- `steps_completed`: Count of successfully completed steps
- `steps_failed`: Count of failed steps
- `steps_skipped`: Count of skipped steps

**Relationships**:
- Summarizes one Mission execution
- Aggregates all StepResults
- Referenced by audit reports

**Validation Rules**:
- Overall status must reflect step result aggregation
- Timing data must be consistent and accurate
- Step counts must match actual execution results

**State Transitions**:
```
In Progress → Completed → Archived
```

### AuditEvent
**Purpose**: Immutable log entry with cryptographic integrity for compliance and forensics

**Key Attributes**:
- `event_id`: Cryptographically unique identifier
- `timestamp`: High-precision event timestamp
- `event_type`: Enumerated audit event type
- `actor`: User or system entity that triggered event
- `target`: Resource or entity affected by event
- `details`: Structured event-specific data
- `hash`: Cryptographic hash for integrity verification
- `previous_hash`: Reference to previous audit event (chain)

**Relationships**:
- May reference Mission, MissionStep, or ExecutionContext
- Forms cryptographic chain with other AuditEvents
- Aggregated into audit reports and compliance summaries

**Validation Rules**:
- Events are immutable once created
- Hash must be cryptographically valid
- Chain integrity must be verifiable
- Timestamp must be monotonically increasing

**Security Properties**:
- Tamper detection through hash verification
- Non-repudiation through cryptographic signatures
- Immutable audit trail for compliance

## Data Relationships

### Dependency Graph
```
Mission (1) ←→ (N) MissionStep
MissionStep (1) ←→ (1) StepResult
Mission (1) ←→ (1) MissionResult
ExecutionContext (1) ←→ (1) Mission execution
AuditEvent (N) ←→ (1) ExecutionContext
```

### State Flow
```
Mission Definition → Validation → Context Creation → Step Execution → Result Aggregation → Audit Finalization
```

## Serialization Schemas

### Mission Definition Schema
```yaml
# YAML mission definition format
version: "1.0"
name: "string"
description: "string (optional)"
config:
  timeout_seconds: number (optional)
  fail_fast: boolean (optional)
  parallel_limit: number (optional)
steps:
  - id: "string"
    name: "string"
    step_type: "enum"
    depends_on: ["string"] (optional)
    timeout_seconds: number (optional)
    continue_on_error: boolean (optional)
    parameters: object
```

### Execution Result Schema
```json
{
  "mission_id": "uuid",
  "overall_status": "Success|Partial|Failed",
  "start_time": "ISO-8601",
  "end_time": "ISO-8601",
  "total_duration_ms": "number",
  "step_results": {
    "step_id": {
      "status": "Completed|Failed|Skipped",
      "output": "object",
      "error": "string (optional)",
      "duration_ms": "number"
    }
  },
  "audit_summary": {
    "events_logged": "number",
    "integrity_verified": "boolean"
  }
}
```

## Validation & Constraints

### Business Rules
1. **Mission Integrity**: All referenced dependencies must exist
2. **Execution Order**: Dependencies must form a valid DAG
3. **Resource Limits**: Context size and execution time bounded
4. **Audit Compliance**: All operations must be logged immutably

### Technical Constraints
1. **Performance**: Step execution overhead <200ms
2. **Scalability**: Support 1000+ step missions
3. **Memory**: Efficient context management for large workflows
4. **Security**: All inputs sanitized, all operations validated

### Error Conditions
1. **Circular Dependencies**: Mission validation failure
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Step execution blocking
3. **Timeout Exceeded**: Graceful termination with audit
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Circuit breaker activation
5. **Security Violation**: Immediate execution halt
