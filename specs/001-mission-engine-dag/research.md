# Research: Mission Engine DAG-based Execution System

**Generated**: 2025-01-20  
**Context**: Implementation research for enterprise-grade mission execution engine

## Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for implementing a production-ready DAG-based mission execution engine with enterprise compliance requirements.

## DAG Execution & Topological Sorting

### Decision: Kahn's Algorithm with Cycle Detection
- **Implementation**: Modified Kahn's algorithm with early cycle detection
- **Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = steps, E = dependencies
- **Benefits**: Efficient, handles cycles gracefully, enables parallel execution planning

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Linear complexity suitable for large mission graphs (1000+ steps)
- **Reliability**: Built-in cycle detection prevents infinite loops
- **Parallelization**: Natural identification of independent execution branches

### Alternatives Considered
- **DFS-based topological sort**: More complex cycle detection, harder to parallelize
- **Recursive approaches**: Stack overflow risk with deep dependency chains
- **Simple dependency resolution**: No cycle detection, poor error handling

## Async Execution Patterns

### Decision: Tokio with Semaphore-based Concurrency Control
- **Core Pattern**: `tokio::spawn` for step execution with `Arc<Semaphore>` for resource management
- **Concurrency Model**: Configurable parallelism with graceful degradation
- **Error Handling**: Structured error propagation with context preservation

### Rationale
- **Resource Management**: Prevents resource exhaustion during parallel execution
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of concurrent operations efficiently
- **Ecosystem**: Mature tokio ecosystem with extensive tooling

### Alternatives Considered
- **async-std**: Smaller ecosystem, less enterprise tooling
- **Manual thread management**: Complex synchronization, error-prone
- **Blocking execution**: Poor resource utilization, scalability limits

## Enterprise Audit & Compliance

### Decision: Structured JSON Logging with Cryptographic Integrity
- **Format**: Structured JSON with standardized fields
- **Integrity**: SHA-256 hash chains for tamper detection
- **Storage**: Append-only audit log with rotation policies

### Rationale
- **Compliance**: Meets SOX, GDPR, SOC2 audit requirements
- **Forensics**: Immutable trails for security investigations
- **Integration**: JSON format enables SIEM integration

### Alternatives Considered
- **Binary audit formats**: Less human-readable, harder to integrate
- **Simple text logging**: Insufficient for compliance requirements
- **Database-only audit**: Single point of failure, harder to archive

## Security Architecture

### Decision: Multi-Layer Defense with Policy Engine
- **Layer 1**: Input sanitization (path traversal, command injection prevention)
- **Layer 2**: Policy engine validation (operation approval, resource limits)
- **Layer 3**: Sandbox execution (isolated environments, privilege restriction)

### Rationale
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers prevent single-point failures
- **Configurability**: Policies adapt to different security requirements
- **Zero Trust**: Every operation validated regardless of source

### Alternatives Considered
- **Single-layer security**: Insufficient for enterprise environments
- **Runtime-only validation**: Bypassable through direct API access
- **Hardcoded security**: Inflexible, doesn't adapt to changing requirements

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Lazy Loading with Caching Strategy
- **Mission Loading**: Parse-on-demand with LRU cache for definitions
- **Context Management**: Copy-on-write for execution contexts
- **Result Storage**: Streaming results with configurable retention

### Rationale
- **Memory Efficiency**: Handles large mission graphs without memory bloat
- **Response Time**: Sub-200ms execution overhead for simple operations
- **Scalability**: Supports 1000+ concurrent mission executions

### Alternatives Considered
- **Eager loading**: Memory intensive, poor scalability
- **No caching**: Repeated parsing overhead, slower execution
- **Persistent state**: Complexity without clear benefit for stateless operations

## Error Recovery Strategies

### Decision: Configurable Recovery with Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Fail-Fast Mode**: Stop execution on first error (default)
- **Continue-on-Error Mode**: Execute remaining steps, aggregate results
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic failure detection and recovery

### Rationale
- **Flexibility**: Different missions have different failure tolerance requirements
- **Reliability**: Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- **Observability**: Clear error classification and reporting

### Alternatives Considered
- **Single error mode**: Inflexible for different use cases
- **No circuit breaker**: Poor resilience under failure conditions
- **Manual recovery only**: Requires human intervention, poor automation

## Technology Integration

- **tokio 1.35+**: Async runtime with mature ecosystem
- **serde 1.0+**: Serialization with extensive format support
- **anyhow 1.0+**: Error handling with context preservation
- **tracing 0.1+**: Structured logging with enterprise features
- **uuid 1.6+**: Unique identifiers with cryptographic quality
