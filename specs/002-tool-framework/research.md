# Research: RustChain Tool Framework

**Research Areas**: Plugin architecture, security sandboxing, marketplace economics, schema validation, performance optimization

## Plugin Architecture & Dynamic Loading

### Research Question
How should RustChain implement a secure, performant plugin system that supports both built-in and community-contributed tools while maintaining type safety and enterprise security requirements?

### Options Evaluated

#### Option 1: Trait-based Compile-time Registration ✅ SELECTED
**Approach**: Define `ToolExecutor` trait with compile-time registration via feature flags or build-time tool discovery.

**Pros**:
- Full Rust type safety and performance optimization
- Zero runtime loading overhead
- Static security analysis possible
- No dynamic linking complexity
- Clear dependency management

**Cons**:
- Requires recompilation for new tools
- Limited to tools available at build time
- Community tools need packaging/distribution

**Security**: High - all code statically analyzed and compiled with known dependencies

#### Option 2: Dynamic Library Loading
**Approach**: Load tools as dynamic libraries (.dll/.so) at runtime with C ABI interface.

**Pros**:
- True runtime extensibility
- No recompilation required
- Standard plugin architecture pattern

**Cons**:
- Security risks from untrusted code
- Platform-specific complications
- Complex error handling and debugging
- Memory safety concerns
- Difficult to sandbox effectively

**Security**: Low - dynamic code execution risks, difficult to validate

#### Option 3: WASM Plugin System
**Approach**: Compile tools to WebAssembly for sandboxed execution.

**Pros**:
- Strong sandboxing capabilities
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Clear security boundaries
- Emerging ecosystem support

**Cons**:
- Performance overhead (2-10x slower)
- Limited system access capabilities
- Complex toolchain requirements
- Immature Rust WASM ecosystem for system tools

**Security**: High - strong isolation, but performance trade-offs

### Decision Rationale
**Selected**: Trait-based compile-time registration for core framework with future WASM support for community marketplace.

**Primary reasoning**:
1. **Security First**: Static analysis and compilation-time validation critical for enterprise
2. **Performance**: Tool execution must be <50ms overhead for mission-critical operations
3. **Type Safety**: Full Rust guarantees prevent entire classes of plugin-related bugs
4. **Marketplace Ready**: Foundation supports future WASM integration for community tools

## Security Sandboxing for Tool Execution

### Research Question
How can RustChain ensure secure execution of potentially untrusted tools while maintaining performance and functionality?

### Security Model Design

#### Multi-Layer Security Architecture ✅ SELECTED
```
Layer 1: Parameter Validation (JSON Schema + Rust types)
Layer 2: Policy Engine Checks (enterprise rules)
Layer 3: Resource Limits (CPU, memory, time)
Layer 4: System Call Restrictions (file access, network)
Layer 5: Audit Trail (all operations logged)
```

#### Parameter Validation
**Approach**: JSON Schema validation with Rust type conversion and sanitization.

**Implementation**:
- Pre-execution parameter validation against tool-defined schemas
- Path sanitization for file operations (prevent traversal attacks)
- Command injection prevention for system commands
- Input size limits and type constraints

**Security Benefit**: Prevents malformed input attacks and validates data integrity

#### Policy Engine Integration
**Approach**: Integrate with existing RustChain policy engine for enterprise governance.

**Implementation**:
- Tool execution requires policy approval
- Configurable permission levels (file access, network, commands)
- Role-based access control for different tool categories
- Compliance rule enforcement (e.g., no external network in SOX environment)

**Security Benefit**: Enterprise governance and compliance requirements

#### Resource Limits
**Approach**: Runtime resource monitoring and enforcement.

**Implementation**:
- CPU time limits per tool execution
- Memory usage caps with graceful degradation
- Timeout enforcement with cleanup
- Concurrent execution limits

**Security Benefit**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks and ensures system stability

### Threat Model Analysis

#### High Priority Threats
1. **Malicious Tool Code**: Prevented by compile-time analysis and static registration
2. **Parameter Injection**: Mitigated by schema validation and sanitization
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Addressed by resource limits and monitoring
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Prevented by policy engine and system call restrictions

#### Medium Priority Threats
1. **Data Exfiltration**: Monitored by audit trails and network policy restrictions
2. **Side Channel Attacks**: Limited by execution isolation and monitoring
3. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Managed by supply chain analysis and updates

#### Low Priority Threats
1. **Timing Attacks**: Limited impact due to execution context isolation
2. **Memory Disclosure**: Mitigated by Rust memory safety guarantees
