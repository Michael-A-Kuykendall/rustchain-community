## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
- **Setup (T001-T005) → Security Tests (T006-T013) → Core Enhancement (T014-T021) → Feature Implementation (T022-T058) → Validation (T059-T072)**

### Specific Dependencies
- T006-T013 must fail before T014-T021 can begin (TDD requirement)
- T014 (ToolRegistry) blocks T031 (publication workflow)
- T015 (discovery) blocks T036 (marketplace search)
- T016 (security scanner) blocks T042 (vulnerability scanner)
- T020 (marketplace integration) blocks T031-T038 (marketplace features)
- T053-T058 must complete before T066-T069 (integration tests)

### Parallel Execution Blocks
**Block 1 - Security Tests (T006-T013)**:
```rust
// Can run simultaneously - different test files
cargo test test_parameter_security
cargo test test_sandbox_security  
cargo test test_policy_enforcement
cargo test test_audit_integrity
cargo test test_resource_limits
cargo test test_security_validation
cargo test test_injection_prevention
cargo test test_schema_bypass
```

**Block 2 - Core Enhancement (T014-T017)**:
```rust
// Can run simultaneously - different concerns in separate files
// Registry, discovery, security, validation - independent modules
```

**Block 3 - Built-in Tools (T022-T030)**:
```rust
// Can run simultaneously - independent tool implementations
cargo test test_file_tools
cargo test test_http_tools
cargo test test_command_tools
cargo test test_database_tools
cargo test test_ai_tools
cargo test test_web_tools
```

**Block 4 - Marketplace Features (T031-T037)**:
```rust
// Can run simultaneously - independent marketplace modules
cargo test test_publication
cargo test test_rating
cargo test test_quality
cargo test test_revenue
cargo test test_curation
```

## Parallel Example
```bash
# Launch Block 1 (Security Tests) together:
Task: "Parameter validation security test in tests/tools/test_parameter_security.rs"
Task: "Tool sandboxing security test in tests/tools/test_sandbox_security.rs"
Task: "Policy engine integration test in tests/tools/test_policy_enforcement.rs"
Task: "Audit trail integrity test in tests/tools/test_audit_integrity.rs"

# After Block 1 completes, launch Block 2 (Core Enhancement):
Task: "Enhance ToolRegistry with marketplace features in src/tools/registry.rs"
Task: "Implement advanced tool discovery in src/tools/discovery.rs"
Task: "Create tool security scanner in src/tools/security.rs"
Task: "Enhance tool parameter validation in src/tools/validation.rs"
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Security Requirements
- All tool parameters must be validated using JSON Schema with Rust type safety
- All tool execution must be sandboxed with configurable resource limits
- Policy engine must be consulted before any tool execution
- Audit events must be generated for all security-relevant operations
- Marketplace tools must pass security scanning before publication

### Performance Targets
- **Tool Registration**: <100ms for individual tool registration
- **Tool Discovery**: <50ms for searches across 10,000+ tools
- **Tool Execution Overhead**: <50ms per tool execution
- **Marketplace Query**: <200ms for complex marketplace searches
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for registry with 10,000+ tools

### Marketplace Requirements
- Quality scoring must be objective and measurable
- Revenue sharing must be transparent and auditable
- Security scanning must be comprehensive and automated
- Community curation must prevent malicious tool publication
- Tool versioning must support backward compatibility

### Testing Requirements
- All new functionality must have corresponding tests
- Security tests must validate both positive and negative cases
- Performance tests must verify target metrics are met
- Integration tests must cover end-to-end workflows
- Test coverage must exceed 95% for tool framework components

### Documentation Requirements
- All public APIs must have comprehensive documentation
- Tool development SDK must include examples and best practices
- Security considerations must be documented for each tool type
- Marketplace guidelines must be clear and enforceable
- Performance characteristics must be documented with benchmarks

## Notes
- **[P] tasks**: Different files or independent concerns, no dependencies
- **Verify tests fail**: Before implementing, confirm tests fail as expected
- **Commit frequently**: After each task completion for easier rollback
- **Existing code**: Leverage and enhance existing implementation rather than rewrite
- **Security first**: All enhancements must maintain or improve security posture
- **Marketplace ready**: All features must support community ecosystem growth

   - 5-minute validation → integration tests (T055, T068)
   - Security scenarios → security tests (T006-T013, T066)
   - Marketplace scenarios → marketplace tests (T068, T031-T038)
   - Performance scenarios → performance tests (T051, T067)

4. **From Research (marketplace and security requirements)**:
   - Community ecosystem → marketplace features (T031-T038)
   - Security patterns → security validation (T039-T045)
   - Performance optimization → performance features (T046-T052)
   - Plugin architecture → framework enhancement (T014-T021)
