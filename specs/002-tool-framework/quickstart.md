# Quickstart Validation: RustChain Tool Framework

**Scenario**: 5-minute validation of tool framework functionality including registration, execution, security, and marketplace features

## Prerequisites
- RustChain installed with tool framework features enabled
- Terminal/command prompt access
- Sample tool implementation file
- Internet connection for marketplace features

## Step 1: Create Sample Tool (1 minute)
**Goal**: Create a simple custom tool to demonstrate registration and execution

### Create Tool Implementation
```rust
// File: my_greeting_tool.rs
use rustchain_tools::{ToolExecutor, ToolCall, ToolResult, Result};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use serde_json::json;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct GreetingParams {
    name: String,
    language: Option<String>,
}

pub struct GreetingTool;

impl ToolExecutor for GreetingTool {
    async fn execute(&self, call: ToolCall, _context: &RuntimeContext) -> Result<ToolResult> {
        let params: GreetingParams = serde_json::from_value(call.parameters)?;
        
        let greeting = match params.language.as_deref() {
            Some("spanish") => format!("¡Hola, {}!", params.name),
            Some("french") => format!("Bonjour, {}!", params.name),
            _ => format!("Hello, {}!", params.name),
        };
        
        Ok(ToolResult {
            success: true,
            output: json!({ "greeting": greeting }),
            error: None,
            execution_time_ms: 1,
        })
    }
    
    fn name(&self) -> &str { "greeting" }
    fn description(&self) -> &str { "Generates personalized greetings" }
    
    fn schema(&self) -> serde_json::Value {
        json!({
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "name": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Name of person to greet"
                },
                "language": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["english", "spanish", "french"],
                    "description": "Language for greeting"
                }
            },
            "required": ["name"]
        })
    }
}
```

**Expected Output**: Tool file created successfully
**Time**: ~30 seconds

## Step 2: Register Custom Tool (30 seconds)
**Goal**: Register the custom tool in RustChain tool registry

### Register Tool Command
```bash
rustchain tools register my_greeting_tool.rs --category="utility" --security-level="safe"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✓ Tool validation passed
✓ Schema validation successful
✓ Security scan completed - no issues found
✓ Tool 'greeting' registered successfully
  - ID: greeting-v1.0.0
  - Category: utility
  - Security Level: safe
  - Schema: 2 parameters (1 required)
```

**Validation Checks**:
- Tool compiles successfully
- Schema is valid JSON Schema
- Security requirements met
- No naming conflicts

**Time**: ~30 seconds

## Step 3: Execute Tool in Mission (1 minute)
**Goal**: Use the registered tool in a RustChain mission

### Create Test Mission
```yaml
# File: tool_demo.yaml
name: "Tool Framework Demo"
description: "Demonstrate custom tool execution"
version: "1.0"

steps:
  - id: "test_greeting"
    step_type: "tool"
    parameters:
      tool_name: "greeting"
      tool_parameters:
        name: "RustChain User"
        language: "spanish"
    
  - id: "test_builtin_file"
    step_type: "create_file"
    parameters:
      path: "/tmp/greeting_output.txt"
      content: "${test_greeting.output.greeting}"
    
  - id: "verify_result"
    step_type: "tool"
    parameters:
      tool_name: "greeting"
      tool_parameters:
        name: "Quality Assurance"
        language: "french"
```

### Execute Mission
```bash
rustchain mission execute tool_demo.yaml
```

**Expected Output**:
```
🚀 Executing mission: Tool Framework Demo

Step 1/3: test_greeting (tool)
  ✓ Tool 'greeting' found in registry
  ✓ Parameters validated against schema
  ✓ Security policies satisfied
  ✓ Executed successfully: "¡Hola, RustChain User!"
  
Step 2/3: test_builtin_file (create_file)
  ✓ Path sanitization passed
  ✓ Content substitution: "¡Hola, RustChain User!"
  ✓ File created: /tmp/greeting_output.txt
  
Step 3/3: verify_result (tool)
  ✓ Tool execution successful: "Bonjour, Quality Assurance!"
  
Mission completed successfully in 245ms
```

**Validation Checks**:
