# Feature Specification: RustChain Tool Framework

**Feature Branch**: `002-tool-framework`  
**Created**: 2025-01-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Component analysis of `src/tools/mod.rs` - Extensible tool registration and execution framework with policy-based access control, parameter validation, audit logging, and plugin system. Must support built-in tools (file operations, HTTP, commands) and custom tool registration with proper error handling and security validation for marketplace readiness.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse component description from Input
   âœ“ Tool Framework provides extensible plugin architecture for RustChain
2. Extract key concepts from description
   âœ“ Actors: Tool developers, marketplace publishers, mission operators, security administrators
   âœ“ Actions: Register tools, execute tools, validate parameters, enforce policies, audit operations
   âœ“ Data: Tool definitions, execution parameters, results, audit trails, marketplace metadata
   âœ“ Constraints: Security sandboxing, parameter validation, policy compliance, marketplace curation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   âš  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Marketplace publishing workflow and revenue sharing mechanisms]
   âš  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Tool versioning and compatibility management across RustChain updates]
   âš  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Community curation and quality assurance processes]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section âœ“
5. Generate Functional Requirements âœ“
6. Identify Key Entities âœ“
7. Run Review Checklist
   âš  Some marketplace clarifications needed but core functionality well-defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**Tool Developers** need a secure, extensible framework to create and distribute custom tools for RustChain missions. **Mission Operators** need access to a curated marketplace of validated tools with guaranteed security and compatibility. **Enterprise Teams** need policy-controlled tool execution with comprehensive audit trails for compliance. **Community Publishers** need revenue sharing and quality metrics for their tool contributions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a custom tool with proper schema definition, **When** developer registers tool in framework, **Then** tool is validated, sandboxed, and available for mission execution with full audit logging
2. **Given** a mission requires file operations, **When** mission executes create_file tool, **Then** operation is policy-validated, path-sanitized, and executed with success/failure tracking
3. **Given** an enterprise policy restricts HTTP access, **When** mission attempts HTTP tool execution, **Then** operation is blocked and policy violation is logged for audit review
4. **Given** a tool execution times out, **When** timeout threshold is exceeded, **Then** operation is gracefully terminated and timeout status is recorded with detailed context
5. **Given** a malicious tool attempts system access, **When** security validation occurs, **Then** tool execution is blocked and security incident is logged for investigation
6. **Given** a tool marketplace with 100+ tools, **When** user searches for capabilities, **Then** tools are discoverable by category, rating, and compatibility with semantic search

### Edge Cases
- What happens when tool execution consumes excessive memory or CPU resources?
- How does framework handle tools with conflicting parameter schemas or naming collisions?
- What occurs when marketplace tool dependencies become unavailable or deprecated?
- How are versioning conflicts resolved when missions depend on specific tool versions?
- What happens when community-contributed tools contain security vulnerabilities?
- How does system handle tool execution in offline or air-gapped environments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide extensible tool registration framework supporting custom tool implementation via standard interfaces
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate all tool parameters against JSON schemas before execution with detailed error reporting
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce policy-based access control for tool execution with configurable permission levels
- **FR-004**: System MUST sandbox tool execution to prevent unauthorized system access or privilege escalation
- **FR-005**: System MUST audit all tool operations with cryptographic integrity for compliance and forensic analysis
- **FR-006**: System MUST support timeout controls for individual tool execution with graceful termination
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide built-in tools for file operations (create, read, edit, delete), HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and system commands with security validation
- **FR-008**: System MUST support tool metadata including descriptions, schemas, versioning, and compatibility information
- **FR-009**: System MUST enable marketplace publication with tool curation, rating, and quality assurance processes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific curation workflow]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide tool discovery mechanisms with search, filtering, and recommendation capabilities
- **FR-011**: System MUST support tool versioning with backward compatibility validation and migration paths [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: version compatibility matrix]
- **FR-012**: System MUST enable revenue sharing for marketplace tool publishers with transparent accounting [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: payment processing integration]
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate tool security through automated scanning and community review processes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: security scanning criteria]
- **FR-014**: System MUST support tool collections and bundles for common workflow patterns
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide performance monitoring and optimization recommendations for tool execution
- **FR-016**: System MUST enable tool dependency management with automatic resolution and conflict detection
- **FR-017**: System MUST support offline tool execution for air-gapped environments with local tool repositories
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide comprehensive tool documentation generation with examples and best practices

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tool**: Executable plugin with metadata, schema, implementation, versioning, and marketplace information
- **ToolRegistry**: Central repository managing tool registration, discovery, validation, and lifecycle operations
- **ToolCall**: Execution request containing tool identifier, parameters, metadata, timeout, and execution context
- **ToolResult**: Execution outcome with success status, output data, error information, performance metrics, and audit trail
- **ToolSchema**: Parameter validation specification with types, constraints, defaults, and documentation
- **ToolPolicy**: Access control rules defining permissions, restrictions, and compliance requirements for tool execution
- **ToolMarketplace**: Community platform for tool publication, discovery, rating, and revenue sharing
- **ToolMetadata**: Descriptive information including author, version, compatibility, dependencies, and quality metrics
