## Summary
An extensible tool framework enabling secure plugin development, marketplace distribution, and enterprise-grade execution with comprehensive policy enforcement, audit trails, and performance monitoring. Supports built-in tools (file, HTTP, command) and custom tool registration with marketplace readiness for community-driven ecosystem growth.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+  
**Primary Dependencies**: tokio (async runtime), serde (serialization), anyhow (error handling), serde_json (schemas), reqwest (HTTP), uuid (identifiers)  
**Storage**: In-memory tool registry with persistent marketplace metadata and audit trails  
**Testing**: cargo test with comprehensive unit, integration, and security test coverage  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) with enterprise and marketplace focus  
**Project Type**: single (core extensibility framework library)  
**Performance Goals**: <50ms tool execution overhead, support for 10,000+ registered tools  
**Constraints**: Memory-efficient execution, cryptographic audit integrity, zero-trust security model, marketplace compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise-grade with marketplace ecosystem supporting community tool development

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**RustChain Core Principles Assessment**:
- ✅ **Library-First**: Tool framework is core extensibility library exposing clean plugin API

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Core extensibility framework library

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Areas Identified**:
1. Plugin architecture patterns and dynamic loading mechanisms
2. Security sandboxing for untrusted code execution
3. Marketplace economics and community-driven ecosystems
4. Schema validation and parameter type systems
5. Performance optimization for plugin registries

**Research Results**:

### Plugin Architecture & Dynamic Loading
- **Decision**: Trait-based plugin system with compile-time registration
- **Rationale**: Type safety, performance, no dynamic linking complexity, easier security validation
- **Alternatives considered**: Dynamic libraries (security risks), WASM (performance overhead), external processes (communication complexity)

### Security Sandboxing
- **Decision**: Multi-layer validation with policy engine integration and resource limits
- **Rationale**: Defense in depth, configurable restrictions, audit trail integration, enterprise compliance
- **Alternatives considered**: Process isolation (overhead), containers (complexity), runtime sandboxes (limited control)

### Marketplace & Community
- **Decision**: Metadata-driven marketplace with quality metrics and curation workflows
- **Rationale**: Community trust, quality assurance, revenue sharing transparency, discoverability
- **Alternatives considered**: Centralized approval (bottleneck), fully open (quality issues), external marketplace (fragmentation)

### Schema Validation
- **Decision**: JSON Schema with Rust type generation and runtime validation
- **Rationale**: Industry standard, tooling ecosystem, clear documentation, type safety
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom DSL (adoption barrier), Rust macros (complexity), runtime-only validation (no IDE support)

### Performance Optimization
- **Decision**: Lazy loading with caching and concurrent execution support
- **Rationale**: Memory efficiency, fast startup, scalable to thousands of tools
- **Alternatives considered**: Eager loading (memory usage), no caching (repeated validation overhead), synchronous execution (performance bottleneck)

**Output**: research.md complete ✅

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model (data-model.md)
**Core Entities**:
- **Tool**: Plugin definition with implementation, metadata, schema, and marketplace information
- **ToolRegistry**: Central management system for tool lifecycle and discovery operations
- **ToolCall**: Execution request with parameters, context, timeout, and security constraints
- **ToolResult**: Execution outcome with results, metrics, audit data, and error information
- **ToolPolicy**: Access control configuration with permissions, restrictions, and compliance rules
- **MarketplaceEntry**: Community marketplace metadata with ratings, revenue, and quality metrics

### API Contracts (contracts/)
**Core Tool APIs**:
```rust
// Tool execution interface
pub async fn execute_tool(call: ToolCall) -> Result<ToolResult>

// Tool registration interface  
pub fn register_tool(tool: Box<dyn ToolExecutor>) -> Result<()>

// Tool discovery interface
pub fn discover_tools(query: ToolQuery) -> Result<Vec<ToolMetadata>>

// Marketplace interface
pub async fn publish_tool(tool: MarketplaceTool) -> Result<PublicationResult>

// Security validation interface
pub fn validate_tool_security(tool: &Tool) -> Result<SecurityReport>
```

### Contract Tests Generated
- Tool registration and discovery workflows
- Security validation and policy enforcement  
- Marketplace publication and curation processes
- Parameter validation and schema compliance
- Performance benchmarking and resource monitoring
- Audit trail integrity and compliance reporting

### Quickstart Validation (quickstart.md)
**5-minute validation scenario**:
1. Register custom tool: `rustchain tools register my_tool.rs`
2. Execute tool in mission: `rustchain mission execute tool_demo.yaml`
3. Verify security: `rustchain tools security-scan my_tool`
4. Check audit trail: `rustchain audit report --tool-operations`
5. Publish to marketplace: `rustchain tools publish my_tool --dry-run`

**Post-Design Constitution Check**: PASS ✅
- All principles maintained in design
- Clean separation of plugin architecture
- Enterprise security and marketplace requirements met

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Analyze existing tool framework implementation and identify enhancement opportunities
- Generate security validation tasks for all tool execution paths
- Create comprehensive test coverage for tool registration, execution, and marketplace workflows
- Marketplace integration and community features implementation
- Performance optimization and scalability testing

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Security and validation infrastructure first
- Core tool framework enhancement and expansion
- Built-in tool implementation and testing
- Marketplace features and community integration
- Performance optimization and enterprise features

**Estimated Output**: 45-50 numbered, ordered tasks focused on extensibility, security, and marketplace readiness

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, marketplace validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - all principles maintained*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
