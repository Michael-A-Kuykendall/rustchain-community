# DoD NIST 800-53 Controls Implementation Plan

## Critical Controls Analysis
{analyze_nist_controls_for_ai}

## RustChain Implementation Status
- [ ] AC-2: Account Management - User authentication and authorization
- [ ] AU-2: Audit Events - Security event identification and logging
- [ ] IA-2: Identification and Authentication - Multi-factor authentication
- [ ] SC-8: Transmission Confidentiality - Encrypted communications
- [ ] SI-4: Information System Monitoring - Continuous security monitoring

## SMT Constraint Requirements
- Access control verification: (authenticated user) ∧ (authorized action)
- Audit completeness: ∀ security_event → logged(event)
- Encryption validation: ∀ transmission → encrypted(transmission)

## FedRAMP/ATO Readiness
1. Control implementation documentation
2. Continuous monitoring capabilities
3. Automated compliance verification
4. Risk assessment and management
