# RustChain FedRAMP Authorization Roadmap

## FedRAMP Requirements Analysis
{analyze_fedramp_requirements}

## Authorization Strategy
- **Target**: FedRAMP Moderate baseline (NIST 800-53 325 controls)
- **Approach**: Cloud Service Provider (CSP) authorization
- **Timeline**: 12-18 months to ATO
- **Competitive Advantage**: Mathematical compliance proof via SMT

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Control Implementation (Months 1-6)
- [ ] Implement all 325 FedRAMP Moderate controls
- [ ] Create mathematical proofs for each control
- [ ] Develop continuous monitoring system

### Phase 2: Documentation (Months 7-9)
- [ ] System Security Plan (SSP) development
- [ ] Control implementation evidence
- [ ] Mathematical proof documentation

### Phase 3: Assessment (Months 10-12)
- [ ] Third-party assessment organization (3PAO) engagement
- [ ] Control testing and validation
- [ ] Remediation of findings

### Phase 4: Authorization (Months 13-18)
- [ ] JAB review and approval
- [ ] ATO issuance
- [ ] Continuous monitoring implementation
